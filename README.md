# shiny_dplyr

trying to make a shiny app based on [Jesse](https://twitter.com/kierisi)'s [tweet](https://twitter.com/kierisi/status/1036293295352229889) (with her [permission](https://twitter.com/kierisi/status/1036395821091172353)) :)  

not gonna touch the conceptual visualisation/gganimate part until [Garrick](https://twitter.com/grrrck) and [Dav](https://twitter.com/dav_zim) have done their [magic](https://twitter.com/grrrck/status/1036304447385870336) :P
